Findings: Law students began to graduate earlier in 2010 (p<0.0001) as determined through statistical testing comparing those who graduated in less than three years to those who graduated in three years or more.

Methods: Two tests of group differences were performed. Chi-square results were from a t-test assuming normal distribution and a WIlcoxon test assuming non-normal (non-parametric) distribution, were used to test group differences in non-parametric data. Both tests found 2010 to be a significant time point in terms of early graduation. Early graduation was defined as those who graduated in 2 and 2.5 years versus those who graduated in 3, 3.5, 4, and 4.5 years. Chi-square values were statistically significant (p<0.0001).
